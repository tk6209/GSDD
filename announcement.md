# GSDD v0.1.0 — Open Method Release

GSDD (Governed Specification-Driven Development) is now available as an Open Method.

GSDD defines a governed execution model where:
- No execution is allowed without an explicit SPEC
- Ambiguity triggers STOP
- Outcomes MUST be audited before commit
- Auto-healing is forbidden

This release provides:
- GSDD Core Law (governance)
- Mandatory Execution Flow (ritual)
- SPEC Contract (validity rules)
- Auditability and traceability foundations

GSDD is tool-agnostic.
It can be enforced by humans, LLMs, CI, or a CLI.
