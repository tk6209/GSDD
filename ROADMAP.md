# GSDD Roadmap

This roadmap defines the **governed evolution** of the GSDD method.

Dates are intentionally omitted.  
Progress is gated by **semantic readiness**, not velocity.

---

## v0.2.0 — Audit Contract

Focus:
- Define what *audit means* in GSDD
- No tooling, no automation

Deliverables:
- Normative audit contract
- Audit boundaries and prohibitions
- Clear separation between execution and verification

---

## v0.3.0 — Evidence & Snapshot Semantics

Focus:
- Evidence, not correction
- Traceability without coupling

Deliverables:
- Snapshot artifact schema
- Execution ledger semantics
- Immutable evidence model

---

## v1.0.0 — Stable Open Method

Exit criteria:
- Method semantically closed
- CLI minimal and stable
- No implicit behavior
- External adoption validated

---

GSDD evolves by **tightening limits**, not by adding features.
